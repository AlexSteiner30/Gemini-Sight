                <p>Our team created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AlexSteiner30/Gemini-Sight/">this GitHub repository</a> which is our submission for the Gemini API Developer Competition by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AlexSteiner30">Alex Steiner</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Epic-legend128">Fotios Vaitsopoulos</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lorenzo.dominijanni/">Lorenzo Dominijani</a>. We are a group of students attending H-Farm International School of Treviso, challenging ourselves to enhance our skills and create a project we can be proud of by participating in the Gemini Developer Competition. This global competition, hosted by Google, showcases the real-world applications of the new Gemini model, with a cash prize for the winner.</p>
                <p>Although we joined the competition one month late due to internal exams, we began our project in early to mid-June. Our idea was to create smart glasses entirely powered by Gemini and fully integrated with Google services such as Google Docs, Google Drive, Gmail, YouTube Music, Google Maps, Google Calendar, and Google Events. These glasses are designed to automate tasks through a single voice command. Additionally, equipped with a camera, they allow the user to ask for information about their surroundings, with the model responding in real time.</p>
                <p>Alex Steiner developed the Flutter application, the glasses' circuit and code, and two WebSockets. Fotios Vaitsopoulos developed the entire website, while Lorenzo Dominijani created the video presentation and the 3D model for the glasses. The logo was designed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilian-piovesana-333b572b1/">Lilian Piovesana</a>.</p>

                <h1>Alex Steiner</h1>
                <p><strong><em>"Alex, get off the computer!"</em></strong> That's probably the sentence I heard the most in my entire life. At only 16 years old, my mum would always shout from the kitchen for me to stop being on the computer and do something else. It’s not as if I was on my computer all day long—I was also really into sports, especially basketball. However, whenever I had the opportunity or spare time, I would spend it on my computer, learning something new every day. This is more or less how I ended up here, competing in a Google competition. I guess those hours spent on the computer weren’t that bad, right mum?</p>
                <p>But let’s take a step back. My journey dates back to 2015 when I was 9 years old. I received one of those all-in-one, crappy ACER computers. For no reason at all, I went on YouTube and searched <strong><em>"How To Make A Video Game."</em></strong> From there, my adventure began. Coding is fun for me but sometimes it turns out it’s actually my biggest nightmare and the amount of pain it creates makes me wonder what went wrong in that 9-year-old head. I created a very wonky top-down racing game and messed around with Scratch, before moving on to Python, Node.js, C#, and the Unity Engine. I focused on developing video games and backend applications over the next few years. I even created a copy of the Among Us game (by reverse-engineering the assets from the game) but spiced it up by developing it for the best video game console ever created: the Nintendo 3DS.</p>
                <p>In 2021, I left the beautiful country of San Marino to attend H-Farm International School. I think this was the turning point in my <strong><em>"career,"</em></strong> if you can call it that. With the many opportunities the campus offered, I started developing project after project. I also picked up machine learning using TensorFlow and PyTorch. The school, being focused on business and technology, has these competitions that every first-year high school student attends. We are randomly divided into groups and have to create a startup. My group developed a 3D GAN that was able to create 3D models from a given text, although it was limited by the very small dataset I had access to. Long story short, my group won the competition.</p>
                <p>I also learned about electronics and how painful it is. One of my most notable projects is a vertical farm system that automatically handles water, light, and air systems, and can be controlled remotely with an integrated camera. Furthermore, multiple farms can be added.</p>
                <p>And yeah, this is how I got here, competing in a Google competition. I appreciate everyone for checking out Gemini Sight!</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic;">P.S. Please don’t judge my code. I am more than aware it's bad.</p>

                <h1>Fotios Vaitsopoulos</h1>
                <p>I am a young developer who got interested in programming and coding at an early age through a mentor which I used to have. Ever since then, I have been constantly studying different fields of programming, from web and game development, by creating simple games and feature-heavy websites, to algorithms, data structures and graphs, which I have used to participate in multiple competitions and to improve my problem-solving skills. Now with the rise of AI, I have also begun to show some interest in this field which is why the moment I learnt of this competition I was immediately eager to join.</p>
                <p>I envision that with this project I will be able to greatly increase my knowledge of the Gemini API as well as some aspects of app and web development. I am also hoping to make some sort of impact on society if this product manages to gain some traction.</p>

                <h1>Lorenzo Dominijani</h1>
                <p>Hi everyone, today I want to tell you about my story and how I arrived here competing for Google. Since I was very very little I tried to do as many things as I could, for example trying out basically all sports on this earth, football, basketball, parkour and many others, then, when Covid-19 came around, when I freshly started the Italian middle school, I tried something else, I became a magician, which became my main passion for the next 2 years, it may look childish but it helped me a lot: I started viewing things from a totally different point of view and learned how to interact with people, manage an audience and many other great skills.
                    After this fun and yet fantastic stage of my life, ahead of starting the first year of Italian high school, I understood that the environment I was in could not give me all the opportunity to exploit what I thought was my potential. 
                    So, in September 2023 I concluded that I had to radically change something in my life. I decided to leave my life as a normal Italian student behind and move to one of the most innovative European campuses, H-FARM. 
                    I started my path in H-FARM as a very shy student, but after a couple of months I started to express the real side of Lorenzo, taking all the opportunities that the H-FARM environment was giving me, I created a creative studio called “A Good Eye” that help companies and small reality to express themself in the best and most natural way possible on the social media, and now I’m here, competing for Google with one of my best friends and one of the people that I consider the smartest and most genius on Earth.
