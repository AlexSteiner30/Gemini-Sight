                <p>This repository is the submission for the Gemini API Developer Competition by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AlexSteiner30">Alex Steiner</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Epic-legend128">Fotios Vaitsopoulos</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lorenzo.dominijanni/">Lorenzo Dominijani</a>. We are a group of students attending H-Farm International School of Treviso, challenging ourselves to enhance our skills and create a project we can be proud of by participating in the Gemini Developer Competition. This global competition, hosted by Google, showcases the real-world applications of the new Gemini model, with a cash prize for the winner.</p>
                <p>Although we joined the competition one month late due to internal exams, we began our project in early to mid-June. Our idea was to create smart glasses entirely powered by Gemini and fully integrated with Google services such as Google Docs, Google Drive, Gmail, YouTube Music, Google Maps, Google Calendar, and Google Events. These glasses are designed to automate tasks through a single voice command. Additionally, equipped with a camera, they allow the user to ask for information about their surroundings, with the model responding in real time.</p>
                <p>Alex Steiner developed the Flutter application, the glasses' circuit and code, and two WebSockets. Fotios Vaitsopoulos developed the entire website, while Lorenzo Dominijani created the video presentation and the 3D model for the glasses. The logo was designed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilian-piovesana-333b572b1/">Lilian Piovesana</a>.</p>

                <h1>Fotios Vaitsopoulos</h1>
                <p>I am a young developer who got interested into programming and coding at an early age through a mentor which I used to have. Ever since then I have been constantly studying different fields of programming, from web and game development, by creating simple games and feature-heavy websites, to algorithms, data structures and graphs, which I have used to participate in multiple competitions and to improve my problem-solving skills. Now with the rise of AI I have also begun to show some interest into this field which is why the moment I learnt of this competition I was immediately eager to join.</p>
                <p>I am envisioning that with this project I will be able to greatly increase my knowledge of the Gemini API as well as some aspects of app and web development. I am also hoping to make some sort of impact on society if this product manages to gain some traction.</p>
