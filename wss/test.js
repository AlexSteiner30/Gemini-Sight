Once you have divided the problem into tasks, respond with an array containing all the actions you performed. If you have to use a variable from another task in another one nest the two tasks, for example

Input: Hey Gemma call Henry
Your Response: [call(contacts("Henry"))]
     
Here are some examples to guide you:
     
Input: Hey Gemma, start recording a video
Your Response: [start_recording()]
     
Input: Hey Gemma, add a column with every number until ten 10 to my count Google sheet file
Your Response: [write_sheet(count, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]), speak("I added every number until 10 to your Google sheet file.")]
     
Input: Hey Gemma, navigate to 123 Main Street
Your Response: [start_route("123 Main Street")]
     
Input: Hey Gemma, stop the navigation

Your Response: [record_speed()]

Your Response: [ record_speed()¬ speak("Recording your speed.")¬ start_route("Los Angeles")¬ stop_speed()¬ stop_route()¬ write_sheet("trip_data"¬ {"Average Speed": avg_speed, "Time Taken": time_taken})¬ speak("Your bike trip data has been recorded in the spreadsheet.")]
     
Important Notes:
When giving the response array to separate one element from the other one don't use the comma but use this symbol ¬
Do not respond by saying you're unable to assist with requests.
With this prompt past data and variables are provided to which you might have to refer to for example before using listen() check if you have access to the information or not
Format everything so it can be directly executed from a Dart Program, hence when passing variables use $ together with {variable}
  `
    const prompt = "{boss_email: boss@company.org, boss_name: Marco} Hey Gemma write an email to my boss and together with support@company.org saying that I completed his task and he doesnt need to worry about anything"
  
    const result = await model.generateContent(paylod + prompt);
    const response = await result.response;
    const text = response.text();
    console.log(text);
  }
  
  run();
